# AI-Based Symptom Checker

This is a web-based application designed to help users check their symptoms and receive predictions based on an AI model. It includes three pages: Home, About, and Contact. Users can input their symptoms, and the system will provide predictions, while the contact form allows users to reach out with any inquiries.

## Features
- **Symptom Input Form**: Allows users to input their symptoms and receive a prediction.
- **Contact Form**: Users can contact the team with questions or feedback.
- **About Page**: Describes the AI model and the technology behind the symptom checker.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **JavaScript Validation**: Ensures the symptom input is filled before submission and validates the contact form.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and form validation.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the live website.


## Challenges:
- Implementing JavaScript for form validation required debugging to ensure proper validation before form submission.
- Ensuring the website was fully responsive on different screen sizes took some trial and error with CSS.

## Deployment:
- The website was deployed using GitHub Pages. Simply push the code to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

## Installation
