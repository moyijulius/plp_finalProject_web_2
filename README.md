### **Assignment: Final Project ‚Äì Designing, Coding, and Deploying a Multipage Website** üåêüöÄ

---

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this assignment is to create a **multipage website** that is fully designed, coded, and deployed on a hosting platform. By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of **front-end web development**, including **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, and **deployment** to live servers. This will showcase your ability to build a **responsive** and **interactive** website that is ready for production.

### **Project Requirements:**

1. **Website Design**:
   - **Design a website** that has at least **three pages** (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
   - Each page should have **unique content** but maintain a consistent layout and design (using a **common theme** or **template**).
   - The website should be **responsive**, meaning it must look good and function properly on devices of all sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - You are encouraged to use **modern design trends** (flat design, minimalism, or material design) and **UI/UX principles**.

2. **HTML5 Structure**:
   - Use semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.).
   - Ensure the website has a **navigation menu** that allows users to navigate between pages.

3. **CSS3 Styling**:
   - Create a **style sheet** using **CSS3** to design your website (you may use **CSS frameworks** like **Bootstrap** or **TailwindCSS** to speed up the process, but it is not mandatory).
   - Implement **CSS3 transitions** and **animations** to enhance interactivity (e.g., hover effects, smooth scrolling, fade-in elements).
   - Make sure your website is **responsive**, using **media queries** to adjust the layout for various screen sizes.

4. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Incorporate **JavaScript** to add interactivity to your website (e.g., form validation, image sliders, modals, or interactive maps).
   - Use **event listeners** (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`) for user interactions.
   - Ensure **form validation** is functional for all forms on the website (e.g., contact form, subscription form).

5. **Optimizations**:
   - Optimize your images (compress them without losing quality).
   - Minify your CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Test your website on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices to ensure compatibility.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy your website to a **hosting platform**. Choose one of the following platforms for deployment:
     - **GitHub Pages**
     - **Netlify**
     - **Vercel**
   - Ensure that your website is **live** and accessible on the internet via a unique URL.

### **Deliverables:**

1. **Website Files**:
   - HTML files for each page (e.g., `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`).
   - CSS file(s) for styling.
   - JavaScript file(s) for functionality.
   - All images and assets used in the project (stored in an `assets/` folder).
   - README.md file with a description of the project and instructions on how to run it locally.

2. **Live Website**:
   - Provide a **link to the live website** deployed on your chosen hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
   - Ensure that the website is fully functional, responsive, and looks good across devices.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Write a brief **documentation** (100-200 words) explaining:
     - Your design choices (why you chose the layout, colors, etc.).
     - The features you implemented using **JavaScript** (e.g., form validation, interactive elements).
     - Any challenges you faced during development and how you overcame them.
     - The deployment process you followed.
